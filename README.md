Here are five features in bullet point format for my project README.md file:

####Featured event Display:

Displays featured jobs or events from a JSON file.
Provides users with information about community and cultural events.
####Dynamic Data Loading:

Utilizes React's useState and useEffect hooks to load job data dynamically.
Data is fetched from a JSON file when the component mounts.
####Pagination for Featured Jobs:

Initially shows a limited number of jobs.
Users can load all available jobs by clicking a "Show All Events" button.
Enhances user experience by reducing initial loading time.
####Responsive Design:

Uses responsive CSS classes like text-5xl, p-14, and mb-5.
Ensures a visually appealing and functional layout on various screen sizes and devices.
####Event Filtering and Sorting:

If applicable, mention any features for sorting or filtering events.
For example, users might be able to sort events by date or filter by category.
Include these bullet points in your README.md file, along with any additional information, setup instructions, and usage guidelines for this project.
